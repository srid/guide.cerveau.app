# Known issues

- Images from static folder do not show up if the repo is private[^privimg]
- Very large notes may render slow

[^privimg]: You may either switch to a public repo, or use absolute URLs to images hosted somewhere publicly. Regardless, the static site generated by neuron should display the images correctly.

## Git sync

If you had changed your repository outside of Cerveau, remember to 'sync' it in Cerveau the next time you come back to it.
