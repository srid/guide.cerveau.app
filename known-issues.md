# Known issues

- Images from static folder do not show up if the repo is private
- Very large notes may render slow

## Git sync

If you had changed your repository outside of Cerveau, remember to 'sync' it in Cerveau the next time you come back to it. Auto-sync will be supported in the near-future.
