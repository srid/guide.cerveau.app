# Cerveau User Guide

[Cerveau](https://www.cerveau.app/) enables you to view and edit your [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) Zettelkasten notes online. By using neuron, your notes are guaranteed to remain [future-proof](https://neuron.zettel.page/philosophy.html). As Cerveau seamlessly works with GitHub, your notes are stored safely and reliably in a [Git repository](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) with full version history.

If you are already familiar with Neuron, see [[[neuron-diff]]] as well as [[[known-issues]]].
