# Differences from neuron

Cerveau uses [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) underneath and as such behaves the same as neuron. However, there are also some differences you should be aware of:

* **Raw HTML** is unsupported. For security reasons, Cerveau will show the raw HTML in your zettel file as-is, without rendering it.
* [Experimental neuron features](https://neuron.zettel.page/experimental.html) are unsupported.

See also [[known-issues]] for some differences not listed here.
